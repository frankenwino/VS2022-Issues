# VS2022-Issues

OS: Mac OS X 10.15.7
VS: Visual Studio Community 2022 for Mac v17.0.3 (build 21)


## 1. How to connect Visual Studio 2022 for Mac to Github?

* Click:
  * Visual Studio menu -> Account -> Add
  * Asked to sign into Visual Studio account (which I do using my personal account) then the sign in screen disappears.
  * I click on Add again and we continue this loop.

## 2. Debugger seems to be disabled.
* Start debugging option is greyed out. (See Debug menu.png)
* Breakpoint not a solid red circle. (See Debug menu.png) 
* Clicking on run executes the entire program. The breakpoint is not hit
* Get a 'Cannot execute /Users/../fuilename.exe' error (which is to be expected - it's a not a Windows machine) (See Cannot Execute.png)
