# Visual Studio Community 2022 for Mac: Two Issues

## Platform 
**OS**: Mac OS X 10.15.7

**VS**: Visual Studio Community 2022 for Mac v17.0.3 (build 21)


## 1. Unable to connect Visual Studio 2022 for Mac to Github
### What I'm doing
* Click on *Visual Studio* menu -> *Account* -> *Add*
* Asked to sign into Visual Studio account even though I already am logged in.
* I re-login using my personal account and the sign in screen disappears.
* Click on *Visual Studio* menu -> *Account* -> *Add* again, expecting to be allowed to add a Github account. Instead, I'm again asked to log into the Visual Studio account and we continue this loop.

## 2. Debugger seems to be disabled.
* Clicking on run executes the entire program. The breakpoint is not hit.
* *Start Debugging* option is greyed out.
* Breakpoint not a solid red circle.

* Get a *'Cannot execute /Users/../fuilename.exe'* error (which is to be expected - it's not a Windows machine)
